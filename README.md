HealthGuru is a health tracker web app that aims to enables individuals to live a healthier lifestyle. It features a calorie tracker, a home page with dashboards, meals, profile, workouts, routines, and social page.
The Web App is developed using Vue.js and firebase and features user authentication to access personalised features with firebase's Api. Several other free online Apis were also implemented in the web app.
